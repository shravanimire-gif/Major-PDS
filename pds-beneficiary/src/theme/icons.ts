// Semantic icon lookup table. Screens ask for a semantic key (e.g.
// "wallet") instead of picking an icon family/name ad hoc, so there is one
// place that decides what each concept looks like.
//
// Resolves the audit's flagged icon inconsistencies:
//   - "brand" (login logo) and "wallet" (wallet card title) used to share
//     the same emoji glyph for two unrelated meanings — they now point at
//     two distinct icons.
//   - "grainWheat" is the ONE icon used everywhere wheat is represented
//     (previously a different emoji glyph in each place).
