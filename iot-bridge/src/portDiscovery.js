/**
 * portDiscovery.js
 *
 * Finds the COM port the ESP32 is on, without hardcoding COM3.
 *
 * WHY AUTO-DETECTION MATTERS HERE
 * Windows allocates COM numbers from its own USB enumeration order. Move the
 * board to a different socket, plug in a phone, reboot with a hub attached, and
 * the same board becomes COM5, then COM11. A pinned port number describes the
 * cable, not the hardware, so the bridge treats it as a hint (IOT_SERIAL_PORT)
 * and identity as something only the board can tell it (the `hello` frame's
 * MAC-derived UID).
 *
 * HOW A BOARD IS RECOGNISED
 * Almost every ESP32 devkit reaches the PC through one of a handful of USB-UART
 * bridge chips, each with a fixed USB vendor ID. Matching on vendor ID is
 * reliable and needs no drivers or probing; matching on the friendly name
 * ("Silicon Labs CP210x...") is not, because it is localised and varies by
 * driver version.
 *
 * The pure functions here take a port list as an argument rather than fetching
 * it, so every discovery decision is testable without a serial port attached.
