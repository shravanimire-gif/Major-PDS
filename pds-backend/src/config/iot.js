    // ---- HARDWARE SAFETY LAYER -------------------------------------------
    // "Is this physical measurement safe/credible for the sensor?"
    //
    // This is NOT the business allocation rule (that is
    // MAX_DISPENSE_TRANSACTION_GRAMS = 4000 in config/allocation.js) and NOT
    // the measurement-deviation rule (that is the commodity_tolerances
    // table). All three stay separate on purpose:
    //
    //   3900 g -> hardware-safe, business-valid for a 4000 g allocation
    //   4100 g -> hardware-safe, business-invalid (never auto-confirms)
    //   4900 g -> hardware-safe, business-invalid
    //   5100 g -> HARDWARE-INVALID: frame rejected, recalibration counter++
    //
    // ASSUMPTION, stated because it cannot be established from the repo:
    // iot-device/README.md is referenced by the firmware for the wiring and
    // calibration procedure but does not exist here, so there is no datasheet,
    // load-cell model or ADC gain recorded anywhere. What IS established:
    // an HX711 24-bit amplifier, a calibration factor derived from an
    // operator-supplied reference weight, and a 5 kg cell. A standard 5 kg
    // strain-gauge cell is rated for 5000 g, tolerates ~120% (6000 g) without
    // permanent damage and is destroyed around ~150% (7500 g).
    //
    // The ceiling is therefore set at the RATED CAPACITY rather than at the
    // safe-overload margin: a reading above the cell's rating is not credible
    // measurement data even though it is not yet physically destructive, and
    // stopping there leaves ~1000 g of margin before any risk of deforming
    // the strain gauge. The previous value of 10000 g was twice the cell's
    // rating and would have accepted readings the sensor cannot produce
    // meaningfully.

    // under DEVICE_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS above, or a device that is genuinely
    // connected would age into 'stale' between touches. 30 s against a 120 s
    // threshold leaves 4 touches of margin.
    //
    // Not per-reading: the ESP32 samples at 10 Hz and the fleet view tolerates
    // minutes of staleness, so an UPDATE per sample would be pure write
    // amplification.
    LAST_SEEN_TOUCH_INTERVAL_MS: 30 * 1000,

    // or a closed bridge is detected by the socket closing, not by silence.

    // or a laptop that slept: no frame of any kind (reading, heartbeat, ping)
    // within this window and the connection is terminated, which fires the
    // 'close' handler and flips the device to OFFLINE.
    //
    // The bridge sends a heartbeat every BRIDGE heartbeat interval (15 s, see
    // iot-bridge/src/config.js), so 45 s is 3 missed heartbeats.
    DEVICE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS: 45 * 1000,
